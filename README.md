<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great ways to travel the world and few people know how to do it the PRO way.

Here, Travisor can help the wanderers in coolest way possible.

Here's why:
* Travisor is an Single Page application, that means everything is ready for you on the go.
* Travisor is simple, less complex and one-click way to find out any restaurant, hotel or attraction wherever in the world.
* It deliver the results in just one click :smile:

Of course, Travisor may not be the best but it makes life simple!

Let's understand how:

* The project uses Google Places API & Google Maps API which provides you the result with just one search.
* Use of ReactJs made it more structured and easily navigable. 
* Travisor filters out the extra clutter which Google Maps has and provides only which is required.
* For the data, I have used Travel advisor API from RapidAPI to fetch required data.

Here's why Travisor is special ðŸ˜ƒ
* Along side Hotels, Restaurants and Attractions, It also provides the weather report.
* Open Weather API makes it possible to show each place weather which makes the traveller to travel with safety considering the weather situation.
