## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Travisor is a Travel advisor by which you can search for hotels, restaurants and attraction in a single go!

Here's why:
* Travel is a single page application so there's so extra clutter.
* You have the option to search any place in the world with an option of filtering the best options.
* Just one click and you can explore the best rated Restaurants, hotels and attractions :smile:

Of course, Travisor may not be the best but it provides Google API maps feature through which you can navigate faster.

Few key features:
* Used Google Maps API and Google Places API for navigation
* Alongside hotels, attractions and restaurants, it also provides us the weather report
* No matter where you want to travel, it shows the correct weather of that place.
